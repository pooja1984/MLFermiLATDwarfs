# MLFermiLATDwarfs

Framework to derive constraints on the (velocity-independent) dark matter pair-annihilation cross-section utilising Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data of Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies (indirect detection), which features a machine learning-based assessment of astrophysical background emission (intrinsic + extrinsic) from these objects.
